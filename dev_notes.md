# Development Notes for Wasserpegel Crawler

This document outlines the current status of the project, the insights gathered so far, and the next steps to complete the task of crawling all water level stations.

## Project Goal

The main objective is to create a robust web crawler that can extract water level data for all measuring stations listed on the website of the Hochwassernachrichtendienst Bayern (`https://www.hnd.bayern.de`). The final output should be a single CSV file containing the data from all stations.

## Current Status

- **August 24, 2025**: The `NameResolutionError` has been resolved, and the crawler is now successfully iterating through stations and retrieving correct water level data.
- A Python script `crawler.py` has been developed.
- The script successfully crawls and parses the data for a single, hardcoded station.
- The logic has been extended to fetch a list of all stations from the [station list page](https://www.hnd.bayern.de/pegel/meldestufen//tabellen).
- The script is designed to save the combined data into a `water_levels.csv` file.
- A `README.md` file with general project information has been created.

### Blocker

The crawler is currently failing when attempting to iterate through the list of all stations. The error is a `NameResolutionError`, which points to an issue with how the URLs for the individual station pages are being constructed.

## Insights Gathered

- The water level data for each station is located on a separate page, in a table.
- The station list page contains links to each station's page.
- The core issue is the ambiguity of the `href` attribute in the station links. It is unclear whether these are absolute URLs or relative paths, which leads to the incorrect construction of the final URL for each station.

## Action Plan / Next Steps

1.  **Analyze the Station List Page:**
    - The immediate next step is to fetch the raw HTML of the station list page: `https://www.hnd.bayern.de/pegel/meldestufen//tabellen`.
    - The `href` attributes of the `<a>` tags pointing to the station pages need to be inspected to determine their format (absolute vs. relative).

2.  **Fix URL Construction:**
    - Based on the analysis, the `get_station_data` function in `crawler.py` must be corrected to build the station URLs properly.

3.  **Test the Crawler:**
    - After fixing the URL construction, the crawler should be tested again to ensure it can successfully fetch data from multiple stations.

4.  **Remove the 5-Station Limit:**
    - The script is currently limited to crawling the first 5 stations for testing purposes. This limit needs to be removed to enable crawling of all stations.

5.  **Refine Data Types:**
    - A valuable improvement would be to convert the `DateTime`, `WaterLevel`, `Forecast_Lower`, and `Forecast_Upper` columns to their proper data types (datetime and numeric) to facilitate easier data analysis.

6.  **Finalize and Save:**
    - Ensure that the final, combined DataFrame from all stations is correctly saved to the `water_levels.csv` file.
