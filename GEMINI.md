# Project Summary: Wasserpegel Crawler

This document summarizes the understanding and modifications made to the `wasserpegel_crawl` project during the interaction with the Gemini CLI agent.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to develop a Python web crawler that extracts water level data for all measuring stations from the Hochwassernachrichtendienst Bayern website (`https://www.hnd.bayern.de`) and consolidates this data into a single CSV file.

## Initial State (as understood by Gemini)

*   The `crawler.py` script was developed using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `pandas`.
*   It could fetch a list of all stations and crawl measurement/forecast data for individual stations.
*   The output was a pandas DataFrame with columns: `DateTime`, `Type`, `WaterLevel`, `Forecast_Lower`, and `Forecast_Upper`.
*   A key issue was a `NameResolutionError` due to incorrect URL construction for individual station pages.
*   The project included `README.md`, `dev_notes.md`, `requirements.txt`, and a `.gitignore` file.

## Implemented Features and Refactoring

### 1. Master Data Crawling

**Feature:** Extended the crawler to also extract "Stammdaten" (master data) for each station.
**Implementation Details:**
*   A new function `crawl_station_master_data` was added. This function navigates to each station's main page, finds the "Stammdaten / Lagekarte / Bild" link, fetches the master data page, and parses a table to extract key-value pairs (e.g., "Betreiber", "Messstellen-Nr.", "Einzugsgebiet", etc.).
*   **Geolocation Extraction:** Enhanced `crawl_station_master_data` to extract `Map_X` and `Map_Y` coordinates from a JavaScript block on the master data page using regular expressions. These represent the map's center coordinates.

### 2. Command-Line Parameter for Crawl Mode

**Feature:** Introduced a command-line argument (`--mode`) to switch between crawling "measurements" (default) and "master_data".
**Implementation Details:**
*   The `argparse` module was integrated into `crawler.py` to handle this parameter.
*   The main execution logic (`if __name__ == '__main__':`) was updated to conditionally call either `crawl_station_data` or `crawl_station_master_data` based on the `--mode` argument.
*   The output CSV filename is dynamically set to `water_levels.csv` for measurements and `station_master_data.csv` for master data.

### 3. Code Refactoring and Modularity

**Improvement:** Reduced code redundancy and improved modularity by extracting shared functionalities.
**Implementation Details:**
*   **`_fetch_and_parse_url(url)`:** A helper function created to encapsulate fetching URL content and returning a `BeautifulSoup` object, including robust error handling.
*   **`_find_link_by_text(soup, text_to_find, base_url)`:** A helper function created to find a specific link within a `BeautifulSoup` object by its text and return its absolute URL.
*   `get_station_data()`, `crawl_station_data()`, and `crawl_station_master_data()` were all refactored to utilize these new helper functions, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

### 4. Test Suite (`test_crawler.py`)

**Improvement:** Developed a dedicated test suite to ensure the correctness and stability of the crawler.
**Implementation Details:**
*   A `test_crawler.py` file was created using `pytest`.
*   Tests were implemented for both measurement and master data crawling for a specific test station ("Neu-Ulm").
*   Assertions were added to verify the presence of expected columns and data, including the newly extracted `Map_X` and `Map_Y` coordinates.
*   The test suite was configured to optionally write test CSV files to `data/test` for manual inspection.

### 5. Output Directory and Git Ignore

**Improvement:** Organized output files and updated version control.
**Implementation Details:**
*   A `data/` directory was created in the project root to store generated CSV files.
*   The `crawler.py` script was modified to write all output CSVs into this `data/` directory.
*   The `data/` directory was added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent generated data from being committed to the repository.

## Current Status

The project now has enhanced capabilities for both water level and master data extraction, improved code structure, and a robust test suite to ensure future development is stable.
